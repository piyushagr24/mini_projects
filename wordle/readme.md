# Wordle Mini Project

A simple implementation of the popular Wordle game, built as a mini project.

## Overview

This project is a clone of the Wordle word-guessing game. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word. After each guess, feedback is provided to indicate which letters are correct and in the correct position, which are correct but in the wrong position, and which are not in the word at all.
After the word is revealed it also provides its meaning which helps to improve our vocabulary.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with keyboard or on-screen input
- Visual feedback for each guess (correct, present, absent)
- Customizable word list
- Simple and clean UI
- Implement Wordle game with dictionary integration and meaning lookup
- Added functionality to fetch word meanings from an external API.
- Implemented game logic for a 5-letter word guessing game.
- Included color-coded feedback for user guesses (green for correct letters in the right position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, grey for incorrect letters).
- Created a keyboard display to show the status of each letter.
- Added support for loading words from external text files for guesses and answers.
- Provided an option to reveal the secret word and its meaning.

## Usage

- Enter your guess using the keyboard or on-screen buttons.
